## üßê Introduction / Disclaimer <a name = "about"></a>

*BGS Godot*, or "Board Game Studio - Godot", is an attempt to transform Godot into a development tool for board games, whether virtual or physical. You can use the editor to design board game element templates that can be intuitively and code-free connected to your database, and then used to generate sprite sheets for quick prototyping or even production.

As of now, the codebase is very rough. I implemented barebones functionality during a 12-hour session as a proof of concept. I'm searching for collaborators and testers. Please see more details in my showcase below.
